# Coin Flip Probility Experiment

## About
  - Coin Flip is a homework left by my teacher in Pattern Recognition course.
  - You can use my code for any purpose, your smile is only required.(你開心就好～)
  - As for the detail of this problem, just you can see below.
  
## Problem description
  - Simulate coin A and B with probability of head is 0.7 and 0.5
  - Flip 1000,000 for each coin
  - Calculate the number of  head for each 100 flips 
  - Assume X is the R.V. of the number of  head for each 100 flips  In Coin A, Y is the R.V. of the number of  head for each 100 flips  In Coin B 
  - Plot the histogram of X, Y
  - Find E(X), E(Y), Var(X), Var(Y)
  - Let X is R.V of X and Y
  - Let D is R.V of 0 and 1
    + if P(Z|X) > P(Z|Y)  D = 1
    + otherwise D = 0
  - Verify your results D with X.Y and calculate accuracy.
